A mod for GDevelop web exports for them to run in node, lightweightly without any rendering or polyfilling (no PIXI, DOM, Howler...) üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is in a highly experimental state:
 - Do not use this for production games
 - Do not expect a clean and easy to use interface
 - Do not expect support
 - Do not expect it to work for your game

## Roadmap

 - [x] Runs the Not-A-Vania example's scenes without crashing
 - [x] Runs without a trace of PIXI, DOM or other rendering related APIs, and without images
 - [x] Pre-generates mappings to the resources original sizes to not break logic depending on the image's sizes
 - [x] Script that can export a GDevelop web export to a server
 - [ ] Works with extensions that use node modules
 - [ ] Shims GDevelop renderers for all objects
 - [ ] Special shims that allow to trigger a callback when a visual property of objects is modified
 - [ ] CLI that can export a GDevelop project file to a server
 - [ ] T.H.N.K. Framework support
